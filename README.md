## Description

Zigzag persistence, as introduced by Carlsson and De Silva [[1]](https://arxiv.org/abs/0812.0197), offers a way to better understand the persistence of topological features observed in a family of spaces or pointclouds by generalizing the setting of persistent homology. In this project, we aim at providing a tool to compute levelset zigzag persistence. The idea is to deduce the results from computations on extended persistence, which are already implemented in C++. To this end, we make use of Python bindings.
